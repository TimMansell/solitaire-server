    An online database is used to keep track of game statistics. If, for
    some reason you become disconnected, you will be in offline mode.
  </p>
  <p>Offline mode happens when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The server goes offline</li>
    <li>Your connection to the server goes down or is interupted</li>
    <li>Your connection to the internet has gone down or is interupted</li>
    <li>The server is down for maintenance / updates</li>
  </ul>
  <p>How can I fix this?</p>
  <p>
    Usually the only thing you can do (other than waiting for server to come
    back online) is to refresh the page to initiate a new connection.
